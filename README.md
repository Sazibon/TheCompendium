Repository with basic recommendations for day to day computer use


## Adblockers
Adblockers are mandatory, no discussion. There are different alternatives, but from experience the best solution I have found is:

-General purpose: uBlock Origin ([uBlock origin lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=es) in the case of chrome)

-YOUTUBE: youtube might sometimes detech uBlock Origin, in those cases RedBlock appears to work fine ([RedBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redblock-block-ads-on-you/kgmeeealooifkhhnfoembnihiehmicfd))


## RDP solutions
Remote Desktop Protocol allows to use your computer from another device. This can be usefull in certain scenarios when you want to access your high performing device (dektop PC) from a low performing device (laptop PC) to execute different computationally heavy task or to access local resources in your local network.

-Windows default RDP: this is my favorite solution, since is the most 'fluent' solution in my experience. My goto solution for generic use. Note that setting it up will be noticeably harder than other 'ready to use' solutions.

-[Chrome remote desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/): a more teamviewer-like experience. The user experience is noticeably worst, but it has some benefits, for example you don't close the session when loggin out, and you don't use a virtual GPU for the graphical interface, thus don't have problems with resolution. Much easier to setup.


## Reference managing software

-Zotero: the best solution I have found yet, easy to set up, very versatile, and can be easily adjusted to use the shared collection by linking Zotero's storage folder to a cloud shared folder (dropbox, onedrive, drive) using Windows directory junction functionalities. In an age where cloud storage and privacy has become a premium, this solution works nicely (disable cloud functionalities to go completely 'of the net').

## Mail servies
Sometimes is practical to have a second email address, so that you don't have to sell your soul to any third party webpage that you want to use. Unfortunately the goto solutions as gmail require a mobile phone to register (and their privacy clauses are not ideal...).

-[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/es-es/mail): good alternative to have a secondary mail address, easy to setup, no questions asked. Their working moto is "whats yours is yours", appear to have legitimate interest in mantaining user privacy private (revolutionary idea in this day aand age).

-[10 minute mail](https://10minutemail.com/) & [GuerrillaMail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/): good solution if you need to access that fishy looking webpage. People say that you shouldn't use this since the information is not really private, BUT THAT IS THE FUCKING POINT INNIT? USE THEM AS ONE TIME SOLUTIONS, ALWAYS GIVE FAKE NAMES AND PASSWORDS!!

## Fuck Adobe
Self explaining section:

-[GenP](https://github.com/Cur10s1tyByt3/GenP): In my limited experience it works fine, but since I had already pre-existing adobe software that is BEYOND IMPOSIBLE TO COMPLETELLY ELIMINATE LIKE THE FUCKING COCKROACH ADOBE IS, I had some problems and could not get it to work without constant adjusting. Will retry in the future.

-PDF files: PDFfear works fine, its more basic than Adobe acrobat, mainly in the way comments can be added to documents, BUT IT HAS TEXT EDITING INTEGRATED BY DEFAULT. I started to use it recently, will update with detected limitations and caveats as I find them.

-Drawing: Inkscape works nice for SVG files, but is very unresponsive for heavy bitmap files. Still looking for an appropiate alternative for photoshop.
