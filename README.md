Repository with basic recommendations for day to day computer use

## Adblockers
Adblockers are mandatory, no discussion. There are different alternatives, but from experience the best solution I have found is:

-General purpose: uBlock Origin ([uBlock origin lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=es) in the case of chrome)

-YOUTUBE: youtube might sometimes detech uBlock Origin, in those cases RedBlock appears to work fine ([RedBlock https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redblock-block-ads-on-you/kgmeeealooifkhhnfoembnihiehmicfd])

## RDP solutions
Remote Desktop Protocol allows to use your computer from another device. This can be usefull in certain scenarios when you want to access your high performing device (dektop PC) from a low performing device (laptop PC) to execute different computationally heavy task or to access local resources in your local network.

-Windows default RDP: this is my favorite solution, since is the most 'fluent' solution in my experience. My goto solution for generic use. Note that setting it up will be noticeably harder than other 'ready to use' solutions.

-[Chrome remote desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/): a more teamviewer-like experience. The user experience is noticeably worst, but it has some benefits, for example you don't close the session when loggin out, and you don't use a virtual GPU for the graphical interface, thus don't have problems with resolution. Much easier to setup.

## Reference managing software

-Zotero: the best solution I have found yet, easy to set up, very versatile, and can be easily adjusted to use the shared collection by linking Zotero's storage folder to a cloud shared folder (dropbox, onedrive, drive) using Windows directory junction functionalities. In an age where cloud storage and privacy has become a premium, this solution works nicely (disable cloud functionalities to go completely 'of the net').
